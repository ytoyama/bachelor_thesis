Nowadays, for sentiment classification problems,
several methods using neural network are proposed
and work better than previous methods.
Neural network is capable to extract and utilize complex relations
among factors in input features for sentiment classification.
However, these methods are mostly proposed
for binary or multi-class classification on one category.

As a method to learn semantic representations of several levels
of language expressions, such as documents, paragraphs, and sentences,
the Distributed  Memory model of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) is proposed
and shows good performance on sentiment classification
while it ignores order of sentences in the classification step.

This research proposes a method of sentiment classification
on multiples categories.
The method considers relations among its text, its sentences and categories
and improves classification accuracy over the existing methods.
%
The proposed method classifies reviews in 2 steps.
First, it generates distributed representations of reviews
and their sentences using PV-DM.
Second, it classifies reviews into degrees of ratings
on multiple categories using a fully-connected neural network,
which takes as input an weighted average of
sentence vectors in each review.
At the second step, the relations of texts and sentences in a review
and categories are considered to classify the review.
%
In the experiments, the proposed method showed a better accuracy
than comparative methods and the existing method specialized
for sentiment classification on multiple categories.
This result shows that
the order of sentences in a review is important for sentiment classification
and PV-DM captures some sort of different characteristics of them
when combining a whole document and sentences in a review.
