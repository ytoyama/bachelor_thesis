Sentiment classification of product reviews are important
to analyze sentiment of them for marketing in companies.
The present methods of sentiment classification
on multiple categories of rating
are not capable enough to classify sentiment of a review
considering relations among its text, its sentences and categories.
This research aims to propose a method of sentiment classification
on multiples categories
which considers them and improves classification accuracy better
than the present methods.

The proposed method classifies reviews in 2 steps.
First, it generates distributed expression of reviews and sentences in them
using the Distributed  Memory model of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM),
which shows good performance on sentiment classification.
Second, it classifies reviews by them to classes of degrees of ratings
on labels of multiple categories using the fully-connected neural network
as sentence vectors in each review are compressed
into an weighted average of them.
At the second step, the relations of text and sentences in a review
and categories are considered to classify it.

In the experiments,
And, from the result that the proposed method indicated better accuracy
than the comparative methods and the present method specialized
for sentiment classification on multiple categories,
it is found out that
the order of sentences in a review is important for sentiment classification
and PV-DM captures some sort of different features them
applied to a whole document and sentences in a review.
